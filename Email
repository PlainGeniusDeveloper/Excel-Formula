**Key Details:**

- **Impact on Users:** During this period, users will not be able to add or update content on SharePoint.

**What You Need to Know:**

1. **Read-Only Access:** From [Start Date] to [End Date], SharePoint will be in read-only mode. You will still be able to view and access existing content, but any new content addition or updates will be restricted.
